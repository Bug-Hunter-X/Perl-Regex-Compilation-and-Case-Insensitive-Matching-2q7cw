This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Perl related to regular expression compilation and case-insensitive matching. The `bug.pl` file shows incorrect usage where a compiled regex is reused without considering case-insensitive matching. The `bugSolution.pl` file provides the corrected version.  This bug highlights the importance of understanding how Perl handles compiled regexes when using options like case insensitivity.
